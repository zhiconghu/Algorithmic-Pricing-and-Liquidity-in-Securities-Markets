# Algorithmic Pricing and Liquidity in Securities Markets

This project aims to replicate the results of the paper "Algorithmic Pricing and Liquidity in Securities Markets" by Jean-Edouard Colliard, Thierry Foucault, and Stefano Lovo. 
The paper explores the market microstructure of financial markets under the circumstances that liquidity providers uses reinforcement learning (q-learning) algorithms.

## Monopoly Simulation

This simulates the market with only one liquidity providers.

## Duopoly Simulation

This simulates the market with two liquidity providers.

## Multi-Agent Simulation

This simulates the market with three or more liquidity providers.

## Price Discovery Simulation

This simulates the market with where there are 2 trading rounds and liquidity providers can learn from the first round the underlying value of the traded asset from actions of the trader.
